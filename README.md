The previous directory of this repository was 'DinoGame' which was the original name of this project.

The Chrome DinoGame, also known as the offline T-Rex game, was created by Google Chrome engineer, Sebastien Gabriel, in 2014. The game was designed as a fun way to entertain users when their internet connection was lost. The game features a pixelated T-Rex that jumps over cacti and avoids obstacles, with the player earning points for every successful jump. The aim was to develop a cross-platform Java version in order emulate the classic gameplay experience throughout Mac, Ubuntu and Windows.
